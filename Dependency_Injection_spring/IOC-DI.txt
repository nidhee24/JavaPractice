suppose we have class 

class Test { 
void display();
}

and if we create obj
Test t = new Test()

so using this obj we can access properties and function of class


Suppose if there is a situation of interface and implementing by number of classes and in such scenario 
the above conecpt is not appropriate. or if we want to do component base then it is unappropriate.

So, we have a spring solution by which we can outsource the process of object creation and we need not have to
use new keyword and entire process is outsourced and control is given to spring so it is known as
Inversion of Control.
