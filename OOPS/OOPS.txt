constructor:
usage:
if we check example from attached project, there is setter/getter, constructor, run(), but if we remove
constructor then we need to manually utilize that properties.

eg, if we set one value of property but still it will give error so best way to initialize value is constructor.
By using constructor we can get rid of setter and there is no way to set value so in order to set value there is only 2 ways
like default constructor or parameterized constructor.

power of constructor is that we can apply restriction of how to initialize the values.
