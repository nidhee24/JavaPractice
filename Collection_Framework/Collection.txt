Collections: The Java Collections Framework is a collection of interfaces and classes
which make it easier for storing and processing collection of objects efficiently.

Advantages:
1. No third party API required
2. No need to create API from handling collection objects
3. Collection Framework is tested and optimized.

ArrayList:
list has property to modify the size like add, remove from list and arraylist is a type of list
ArrayList is similar to array has index and data, arraylist are slow when we remove or add because new array will created.
and tends to acquire more memory.
but accessing information is fast and can be access from any location


Stack:
LIFO manner,
extends class Vector
Vector is similar to ArrayList but Vector method are synchronized but ArrayList method are not synchronized

LinkedList:
as name suggest this list is linked with one another.
nodes contains data which linked to other nodes.
Nodes is memory chunks

- node contains data and address of other node

- last node has no further linked address


IMP: Linkedlist is memory efficient and ArrayList is speed efficient.
